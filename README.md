# Employee Survey Analysis Project

## Overview
This project primarily involves SQL-based analysis of an employee survey dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lainguyn123/employee-survey/data) to uncover actionable insights related to work-life balance, stress levels, workload, and sleep habits across various departments and job levels. The focus was designing and executing optimised SQL queries to analyse key trends and patterns in the dataset. Tableau was used to supplement the analysis with visual representations for better storytelling.

## Tools and Technologies Used
- **Draw.io**: Used to create the relational schema for the database.
- **SQL**: Core tool for data extraction and analysis.
- **Tableau**: Supplementary tool for visualization.
- **GitHub**: Version control and collaboration platform.

## Process Overview
The project began with the selection of a dataset sourced from Kaggle, which contained responses from an employee survey. This dataset provided information on various aspects of employee work-life balance, stress levels, workload, and sleep habits. The goal was to perform in-depth SQL analysis to uncover trends and insights that could inform potential improvements in workplace practices.

To ensure a clear and efficient database structure, I used Draw.io to create a relational schema. This diagram helped identify the relationships between key entities, such as employee details, job levels, departments, and survey responses. The schema laid the foundation for translating the data into a well-organized database, ensuring all relevant attributes and relationships were properly captured.

After finalizing the schema design, I proceeded to create the tables in Oracle SQL. This involved defining the structure of each table, including the necessary fields and their data types. Additionally, constraints were applied to ensure data integrity, such as primary keys for unique identification and foreign keys to establish relationships between tables.

With the database set up, I began writing and executing SQL queries to analyse the data. These queries focused on comparing key metrics, such as workload, employee satisfaction, and sleep patterns, across different departments and job levels. The goal was to identify patterns, correlations, and any noteworthy trends that could provide insights into the overall employee experience.

To further enhance the analysis and present the results in a more understandable format, I used Tableau for data visualization. The visualizations provided a clear way to convey the insights derived from the SQL queries, making it easier to spot trends and patterns that might not have been as apparent in the raw data alone.
